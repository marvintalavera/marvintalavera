This is a tic tac toe game written in CSS, Javascript, and HTML.

The rules are simple as every tic tac toe game, just get 3 in a row to win. You can either win or 
get a draw and it is only player vs player, as of right now there is no choice to play vs an AI but
that is soon to come ahead as the browser game gets developed further.

I added many styling components to it to try to make it pop and did small things like hover
to make it feel more cohesive. CSS was my favorite part because I like styling and felt like
it was more of my strong suit as I am someone who is into arts and learns better at things through
visuals.
